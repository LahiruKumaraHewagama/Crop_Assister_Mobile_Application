The crop damage compensation process is made more efficient and less fraudulent by the ability of farmers to submit compensation claims along with evidence of damage. The application will store GPS location details whenever farmers submit evidence of damage and the application will only allow evidence to be submitted via the camera and will not allow submitting previously stored images. This is to minimise fraudulent claims. On the other side, the application will allow the officers from the agriculture department to verify the damage and approve or reject claims with a few clicks. Apart from the main functionalities, the application provides crop detail management and user management.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.


The Boilerplate contains the minimal implementation required to create a new library or project. The repository code is preloaded with some basic components like basic app architecture, app theme, constants and required dependencies to create a new project. By using boiler plate code as standard initializer, we can have same patterns in all the projects that will inherit it. This will also help in reducing setup & development time by allowing you to use same code pattern and avoid re-writing from scratch.
